### What is this about? ü§î

This project is a console application, you can run it directly on the command line or using a docker container (see the Dockerfile inside it).

This code is related to generation and memory optimization of a big CSV file with 20mi lines of data.

The CSV file will be created using random data and with 4 fields. There are two approaches to generate it: using chunks of data or the full list with all lines. I leave the second one commented by default because it needs a lot of memory heap to work and the code implementation is there to show the difference about how we can optimize this.

Run it directly as a console application or by docker container will create a `output/csv_file.csv` file on the relative path.

### Run using Docker üê≥

```bash
# On root project folder
docker build -t <any_image_name> .

# Run the application and expose the file using volume
docker run -t -v $PWD/output:/app/output <any_image_name>
```
