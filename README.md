# Java day-to-day â˜•

Java code examples for study

## What is this? ðŸ¤”

I created this repo after ~5 years working with Java. The main reason was that I realized I skipped some important concepts. My early professional career in Java was a bit disorganized, where I simply learned from existing examples and fixed bugs. I believe this has value, but there's a cost when you're thrust directly into a framework.

I'm not ashamed of this, especially since I followed the unnatural path of "full stack development" with an unusual combination: Java and Vue.js. But I felt the need to create this repository with a summary of concepts and respective examples.

You'll probably see a lot of comments in some code pieces but I'd like to remember: these codes are for study, I don't write a Bible in my work code. ðŸ˜†

## Repo structure

Each folder will be a project with your own structure. Each project will have a README.md explaining more about the goals and some keywords to find a specific topic across the full repository. I'm not creating this considering an specific order of topics, so I do not encourage you to use the projects to study sequentially. Just find the topic that makes sense to you and see if there's anything interesting.

Some projects will be just terminal projects to run but others will be larger with environment configs like databases, containers, etc. But all projects will share the same thing: Java code as base language.

That's all folks!
